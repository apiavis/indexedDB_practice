# IndexedDB Practice

## Overview 

This assignment was part of my software development apprenticeship program. The requirements for the project were to create a client-side data storage mechanism to store/cache some book-like objects from a local JSON file.

The project incorporates DexieJS, a JavaScript wrapper for IndexedDb to perform CRUD operations on the local data store.
